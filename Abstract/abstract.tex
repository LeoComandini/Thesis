\chapter{Abstract}
\label{chpr:abstract}

Proving that data existed prior to a certain time is helpful in several situations.
Thanks to systems achieving distributed consensus without relying on a trusted third party, like Bitcoin, it is possible to enhance the security of such timestamps.
OpenTimestamps is a protocol defining a standard for creating timestamps and, in addition, it provides a scalability solution.
Currently, an improvement concerning elliptic curve commitments has been proposed \cite{PoePR}. 
We aim to give an exahustive overview upon this new scheme, its implications and motivations, culminating in the development of a real world application.
