Proving that data existed prior to a certain times is helpful in several situation.
Thanks to systems achieving distributed consensus without relying of a trusted third party, like Bitcoin, it is possible to enhance the security of such timestamps.
OpenTimestamps is a protocol defining a standard for creating timestamps and, in addition, it provides scalability solutions.
Currently an improvement concerning elliptic curve commitments has been proposed. 
We aim to give a exahustive overview upon this new scheme, its implications and motivations, culminating in the development of a real world application.
